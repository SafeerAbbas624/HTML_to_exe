# HTML to EXE Converter - Instructions

This application converts a website (HTML, CSS, JS, and MP3 files) into a standalone executable file. Follow these instructions to set up and use the converter.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

2. unzip the file sent to you on your local machine.

3. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Install the required dependencies: write the below in terminal
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python html_to_exe.py
   ```

2. The application window should appear.

## Using the Converter

1. Click the "Select Website Folder to convert" button and choose the directory containing your website files (HTML, CSS, JS, MP3).

2. The input and output paths will be displayed in the application window.

3. Choose an expiry option from the dropdown menu. This determines how long the generated executable will be valid.

4. Click the "Convert" button to start the conversion process.

5. The progress bar will show the conversion progress.

6. Once completed, a success message will appear with the output directory path.

7. Navigate to the output directory to find your generated executable file.

## Notes

- The application will create a temporary directory during the conversion process, which will be automatically cleaned up afterwards.
- The output directory will be named `output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` based on the current date and time.
- A `LICENSE` file will be generated in the output directory, containing the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
- If an `icon.ico` file is present in the same directory as the script, it will be used as the icon for the generated executable.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors, they will be displayed in an error message box.
- Ensure all required files are present in the input directory.
- Check that you have write permissions in the directory where the script is located.
